A simple docker container which provides an easy-to-run pseudo-ephemeral shell environment in the current directory.

By default it starts a tmux session with the fish shell.
Command history is persisted between startups.

The base image includes a fully configured neo-vim installation.

A lot of effort went into "making it look nice", obviously subject to my taste :)
